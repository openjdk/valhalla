// Mutator threads produce dirty cards, which need to be examined for updates
// to the remembered sets (refinement).  There is a pause-time budget for
// processing these dirty cards (see -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent).  The
// purpose of concurrent refinement is to (attempt to) ensure the number of
// pending dirty cards at the start of a GC can be processed within that time
// budget.
//
// Concurrent refinement is performed by a combination of dedicated threads
// and by mutator threads as they produce dirty cards.  If configured to not
// have any dedicated threads (-XX:G1ConcRefinementThreads=0) then all
// concurrent refinement work is performed by mutator threads.  When there are
// dedicated threads, they generally do most of the concurrent refinement
// work, to minimize throughput impact of refinement work on mutator threads.
//
// This class determines the target number of dirty cards pending for the next
// GC.  It also owns the dedicated refinement threads and controls their
// activation in order to achieve that target.
//
// There are two kinds of dedicated refinement threads, a single primary
// thread and some number of secondary threads.  When active, all refinement
// threads take buffers of dirty cards from the dirty card queue and process
// them.  Between buffers they query this owning object to find out whether
// they should continue running, deactivating themselves if not.
//
// The primary thread drives the control system that determines how many
// refinement threads should be active.  If inactive, it wakes up periodically
// to recalculate the number of active threads needed, and activates
// additional threads as necessary.  While active it also periodically
// recalculates the number wanted and activates more threads if needed.  It
// also reduces the number of wanted threads when the target has been reached,
// triggering deactivations.
