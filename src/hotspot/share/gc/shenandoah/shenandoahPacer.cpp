/*
 * In normal concurrent cycle, we have to pace the application to let GC finish.
 *
 * Here, we do not know how large would be the collection set, and what are the
 * relative performances of the each stage in the concurrent cycle, and so we have to
 * make some assumptions.
 *
 * For concurrent mark, there is no clear notion of progress. The moderately accurate
 * and easy to get metric is the amount of live objects the mark had encountered. But,
 * that does directly correlate with the used heap, because the heap might be fully
 * dead or fully alive. We cannot assume either of the extremes: we would either allow
 * application to run out of memory if we assume heap is fully dead but it is not, and,
 * conversely, we would pacify application excessively if we assume heap is fully alive
 * but it is not. So we need to guesstimate the particular expected value for heap liveness.
 * The best way to do this is apparently recording the past history.
 *
 * For concurrent evac and update-refs, we are walking the heap per-region, and so the
 * notion of progress is clear: we get reported the "used" size from the processed regions
 * and use the global heap-used as the baseline.
 *
 * The allocatable space when GC is running is "free" at the start of cycle, but the
 * accounted budget is based on "used". So, we need to adjust the tax knowing that.
 * Also, since we effectively count the used space three times (mark, evac, update-refs),
 * we need to multiply the tax by 3. Example: for 10 MB free and 90 MB used, GC would
 * come back with 3*90 MB budget, and thus for each 1 MB of allocation, we have to pay
 * 3*90 / 10 MBs. In the end, we would pay back the entire budget.
