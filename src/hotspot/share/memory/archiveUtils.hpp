//
// The CDS archive is basically a contiguous block of memory (divided into several regions)
// that contains multiple objects. The objects may contain direct pointers that point to other objects
// within the archive (e.g., InstanceKlass::_name points to a Symbol in the archive). During dumping, we
// built a bitmap that marks the locations of all these pointers (using ArchivePtrMarker, see comments above).
//
// The contents of the archive assumes that itâ€™s mapped at the default SharedBaseAddress (e.g. 0x800000000).
// If the archive ends up being mapped at a different address (e.g. 0x810000000), SharedDataRelocator
// is used to shift each marked pointer by a delta (0x10000000 in this example), so that it points to
// the actually mapped location of the target object.
