.SH NAME
.PP
jinfo - generate Java configuration information for a specified Java
process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This command is experimental and unsupported.
.PP
\f[V]jinfo\f[R] [\f[I]option\f[R]] \f[I]pid\f[R]
.TP
\f[I]option\f[R]
This represents the \f[V]jinfo\f[R] command-line options.
See \f[B]Options for the jinfo Command\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]pid\f[R]
The process ID for which the configuration information is to be printed.
The process must be a Java process.
To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use either the
\f[V]ps\f[R] command or, if the JVM processes are not running in a
separate docker instance, the \f[B]jps\f[R] command.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[V]jinfo\f[R] command prints Java configuration information for a
specified Java process.
The configuration information includes Java system properties and JVM
command-line flags.
If the specified process is running on a 64-bit JVM, then you might need
to specify the \f[V]-J-d64\f[R] option, for example:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]jinfo -J-d64 -sysprops\f[R] \f[I]pid\f[R]
.RE
.PP
This command is unsupported and might not be available in future
releases of the JDK.
In Windows Systems where \f[V]dbgeng.dll\f[R] is not present, the
Debugging Tools for Windows must be installed to have these tools work.
The \f[V]PATH\f[R] environment variable should contain the location of
the \f[V]jvm.dll\f[R] that\[aq]s used by the target process or the
location from which the core dump file was produced.
