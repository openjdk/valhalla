BadMessageKey = 找不到對應訊息索引鍵的錯誤訊息。
FormatFailed = 格式化下列訊息時發生內部錯誤:\n

FieldCannotBeNull=無法使用 ''null'' 參數呼叫 {0}
UnknownField=使用不明的欄位呼叫 {0}:{1}
#There are two similar keys 'InvalidXMLGreogorianCalendarValue' . Suffix (year, month) has been added and are used as per the context.
InvalidXGCValue-milli=年 = {0}、月 = {1}、日 = {2}、小時 = {3}、分鐘 = {4}、秒 = {5}、小數秒 = {6}、時區 = {7}，不是 XML 公曆值的有效表示法。
#There are two similar keys 'InvalidXMLGreogorianCalendarValue' . Suffix (year, month) has been added and are used as per the context.
InvalidXGCValue-fractional=年 = {0}、月 = {1}、日 = {2}、小時 = {3}、分鐘 = {4}、秒 = {5}、小數秒 = {6}、時區 = {7}，不是 XML 公曆值的有效表示法。

InvalidXGCFields=XMLGregorianCalendar 設定了無效的欄位集

InvalidFractional=小數秒的值 {0} 無效。

#XGC stands for XML Gregorian Calendar
InvalidXGCRepresentation="{0}" 不是 XML 公曆值的有效表示法。

InvalidFieldValue={1} 欄位的值 {0} 無效。

NegativeField= {0} 欄位為負值

AllFieldsNull=所有欄位 (javax.xml.datatype.DatatypeConstants.Field) 皆為空值。

TooLarge={0} 值 "{1}" 太大，此實行不支援
