/**
 * Represents the CRL Certificate Issuer Extension (OID = 2.5.29.29).
 * <p>
 * The CRL certificate issuer extension identifies the certificate issuer
 * associated with an entry in an indirect CRL, i.e. a CRL that has the
 * indirectCRL indicator set in its issuing distribution point extension. If
 * this extension is not present on the first entry in an indirect CRL, the
 * certificate issuer defaults to the CRL issuer. On subsequent entries
 * in an indirect CRL, if this extension is not present, the certificate
 * issuer for the entry is the same as that for the preceding entry.
 * <p>
 * If used by conforming CRL issuers, this extension is always
 * critical.  If an implementation ignored this extension it could not
 * correctly attribute CRL entries to certificates.  PKIX (RFC 5280)
 * RECOMMENDS that implementations recognize this extension.
 * <p>
 * The ASN.1 definition for this is:
 * <pre>
 * id-ce-certificateIssuer   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ce 29 }
 *
 * certificateIssuer ::=     GeneralNames
 * </pre>
