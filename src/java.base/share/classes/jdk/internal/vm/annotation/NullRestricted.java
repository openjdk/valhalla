/**
 * A null-restricted field is a field that does not store {@code null}.
 * The type of the field is expected to be a value class type with the
 * {@link ImplicitlyConstructible} annotation. The initial value of the field
 * is the zero instance of the given class, and attempts to write {@code null}
 * to the field will throw an exception.
 * <p>
 * The HotSpot VM uses this annotation to enable flattened encodings for the
 * field that would otherwise be impossible.
 * <p>
 * Because these behaviors are not specified by Java SE, this annotation should
 * only be used by internal JDK classes for experimental purposes and should not
 * affect user-observable outcomes.
