/**
 * An inline class implements the {@code NonTearable} interface to
 * request that the JVM take extra care to avoid structure tearing
 * when loading or storing any value of the class to a field or array
 * element.  Normally, only fields declared {@code volatile} are
 * protected against structure tearing, but a class that implements
 * this marker interface will never have its values torn, even when
 * they are stored in array elements or in non-{@code volatile}
 * fields, and even when multiple threads perform racing writes.
 *
 * <p> An inline instance of multiple components is said to be "torn"
 * when two racing threads compete to write those components, and one
 * thread writes some components while another thread writes other
 * components, so a subsequent observer will read a hybrid composed,
 * as if "out of thin air", of field values from both racing writes.
 * Tearing can also occur when the effects of two non-racing writes
 * are observed by a racing read.  In general, structure tearing
 * requires a read and two writes (initialization counting as a write)
 * of a multi-component value, with a race between any two of the
 * accesses.  The effect can also be described as if the Java memory
 * model break up inline instance reads and writes into reads and
 * writes of their various fields, as it does with longs and doubles
 * (JLS 17.7).
 *
 * <p> In extreme cases, the hybrid observed after structure tearing
 * might be a value which is impossible to construct by normal means.
 * If data integrity or security depends on proper construction,
 * the class should be declared as implementing {@code NonTearable}.
