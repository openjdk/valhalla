/**
 * A restricted interface implemented by all identity objects.

 * IdentityObject: An object with identity.
 *
 * *Identity* is a property of certain objects, determined at instance creation
 * time and preserved throughout the life of the object. While an object's field
 * values may change, its identity is constant. Object identities are unique: no
 * two objects created by different instance creation operations can have the same
 * identity.
 *
 * Every object is either an *identity object* or a *primitive object*. Primitive
 * objects lack identity.
 *
 * The following operations have special behavior when applied to identity objects:
 *
 * - The `==` operator, and the default implementation of the `Object.equals`
 * method, compare the identities of their operands, producing `true` for an
 * identity object only if the object is being compared to itself.
 *
 * - The `System.identityHashCode` method, and the default implementation of the
 * `Object.hashCode` method, generate a hash code from an identity object's
 * identity.
 *
 * - The `synchronized` modifier and `synchronized` statement are only able to
 * successfully acquire a lock when applied to an identity object.
 *
 * A class may implement `IdentityObject` or `PrimitiveObject`, but never both.
 * Primitive classes always implement `PrimitiveObject`, while all other concrete
 * classes (except `Object`) implicitly implement `IdentityObject`.
 *
 * Abstract classes and interfaces may implement or extend this interface if they
 * wish to guarantee that all instances of the class or interface have identity.
 *
 * @since 1.16
