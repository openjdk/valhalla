  <title>Value-based Classes</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1 id="ValueBased">{@index "Value-based Classes"}</h1>

Some classes, such as {@code java.lang.Integer} and
{@code java.time.LocalDate}, are <em>value-based</em>.
The compiler and runtime enforce the value based properties below if it is declared
as {@code value class} and preview features are enabled.
A value-based class has the following properties:
<ul>
    <li>the class declares only final instance fields (though these may contain references
        to mutable objects);</li>
    <li>the class's implementations of {@code equals}, {@code hashCode},
        and {@code toString} compute their results solely from the values
        of the class's instance fields (and the members of the objects they
        reference), not from the instance's identity;</li>
    <li>the class's methods treat instances as <em>freely substitutable</em>
        when equal, meaning that interchanging any two instances {@code x} and
        {@code y} that are equal according to {@code equals()} produces no
        visible change in the behavior of the class's methods;</li>
    <li>the class performs no synchronization using an instance's monitor;</li>
    <li>the class does not declare (or discourages use of) accessible constructors;</li>
    <li>the class does not provide any instance creation mechanism that promises
        a unique identity on each method call&mdash;in particular, any factory
        method's contract must allow for the possibility that if two independently-produced
        instances are equal according to {@code equals()}, they may also be
        equal according to {@code ==};</li>
    <li>the class is final, and extends either {@code Object} or a hierarchy of
        abstract value classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>When two instances of a value-based class are equal (according to `equals`), a program
    should not attempt to distinguish between their identities, whether directly via reference
    equality {@code ==} or indirectly via an appeal to synchronization, identity hashing,
    serialization, or any other identity-sensitive mechanism.</p>

<p>Synchronization on instances of value-based classes is strongly discouraged,
    because the programmer cannot guarantee exclusive ownership of the
    associated monitor.</p>

<p>Identity-related behavior of value-based classes may change when implemented as a value class.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The class may choose to allocate/cache instances differently.
    <li>The use of the value class for synchronization or with
    {@linkplain java.lang.ref.Reference object references} result in {@link IdentityException}.
</ul>
