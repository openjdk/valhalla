/**
 * A memory segment provides access to a contiguous region of memory.
 * <p>
 * There are two kinds of memory segments:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A <em>heap segment</em> is backed by, and provides access to, a region of memory inside the Java heap (an "on-heap" region).</li>
 *     <li>A <em>native segment</em> is backed by, and provides access to, a region of memory outside the Java heap (an "off-heap" region).</li>
 * </ul>
 * Heap segments can be obtained by calling one of the {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])} factory methods.
 * These methods return a memory segment backed by the on-heap region that holds the specified Java array.
 * <p>
 * Native segments can be obtained by calling one of the {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long, SegmentScope)}
 * factory methods, which return a memory segment backed by a newly allocated off-heap region with the given size
 * and aligned to the given alignment constraint. Alternatively, native segments can be obtained by
 * {@link FileChannel#map(MapMode, long, long, SegmentScope) mapping} a file into a new off-heap region
 * (in some systems, this operation is sometimes referred to as {@code mmap}).
 * Segments obtained in this way are called <em>mapped</em> segments, and their contents can be {@linkplain #force() persisted} and
 * {@linkplain #load() loaded} to and from the underlying memory-mapped file.
 * <p>
 * Both kinds of segments are read and written using the same methods, known as <a href="#segment-deref">access operations</a>.
 * An access operation on a memory segment always and only provides access to the region for which the segment was obtained.
 *
 * <h2 id="segment-characteristics">Characteristics of memory segments</h2>
 *
 * Every memory segment has an {@linkplain #address() address}, expressed as a {@code long} value.
 * The nature of a segment's address depends on the kind of the segment:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The address of a heap segment is not a physical address, but rather an offset within the region of memory
 * which backs the segment. The region is inside the Java heap, so garbage collection might cause the region to be
 * relocated in physical memory over time, but this is not exposed to clients of the {@code MemorySegment} API who
 * see a stable <em>virtualized</em> address for a heap segment backed by the region.
 * A heap segment obtained from one of the {@link #ofArray(int[])} factory methods has an address of zero.</li>
 * <li>The address of a native segment (including mapped segments) denotes the physical address of the region of
 * memory which backs the segment.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Every memory segment has a {@linkplain #byteSize() size}. The size of a heap segment is derived from the Java array
 * from which it is obtained. This size is predictable across Java runtimes.
 * The size of a native segment is either passed explicitly
 * (as in {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, SegmentScope)}) or derived from a {@link MemoryLayout}
 * (as in {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout, SegmentScope)}). The size of a memory segment is typically
 * a positive number but may be <a href="#wrapping-addresses">zero</a>, but never negative.
 * <p>
 * The address and size of a memory segment jointly ensure that access operations on the segment cannot fall
 * <em>outside</em> the boundaries of the region of memory which backs the segment.
 * That is, a memory segment has <em>spatial bounds</em>.
 * <p>
 * Every memory segment is associated with a {@linkplain SegmentScope scope}. This ensures that access operations
 * on a memory segment cannot occur when the region of memory which backs the memory segment is no longer available
 * (e.g., after the scope associated with the accessed memory segment is no longer {@linkplain SegmentScope#isAlive() alive}).
 * That is, a memory segment has <em>temporal bounds</em>.
 * <p>
 * Finally, access operations on a memory segment are subject to the thread-confinement checks enforced by the associated
 * scope; that is, if the segment is associated with the {@linkplain SegmentScope#global() global scope} or an {@linkplain SegmentScope#auto() automatic scope},
 * it can be accessed by multiple threads. If the segment is associated with an arena scope, then it can only be
 * accessed compatibly with the <a href="Arena.html#thread-confinement">arena confinement characteristics</a>.
 *
 * <h2 id="segment-deref">Accessing memory segments</h2>
 *
 * A memory segment can be read or written using various access operations provided in this class (e.g. {@link #get(ValueLayout.OfInt, long)}).
 * Each access operation takes a {@linkplain ValueLayout value layout}, which specifies the size and shape of the value,
 * and an offset, expressed in bytes.
 * For instance, to read an int from a segment, using {@linkplain ByteOrder#nativeOrder() default endianness}, the following code can be used:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemorySegment segment = ...
 * int value = segment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0);
 * }
 *
 * If the value to be read is stored in memory using {@linkplain ByteOrder#BIG_ENDIAN big-endian} encoding, the access operation
 * can be expressed as follows:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemorySegment segment = ...
 * int value = segment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withOrder(BIG_ENDIAN), 0);
 * }
 *
 * For more complex access operations (e.g. structured memory access), clients can obtain a
 * {@linkplain MethodHandles#memorySegmentViewVarHandle(ValueLayout) var handle}
 * that accepts a segment and a {@code long} offset. More complex var handles
 * can be obtained by adapting a segment var handle view using the var handle combinator functions defined in the
 * {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles} class:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemorySegment segment = ...
 * VarHandle intHandle = MethodHandles.memorySegmentViewVarHandle(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT);
 * MethodHandle multiplyExact = MethodHandles.lookup()
 *                                           .findStatic(Math.class, "multiplyExact",
 *                                                                   MethodType.methodType(long.class, long.class, long.class));
 * intHandle = MethodHandles.filterCoordinates(intHandle, 1,
 *                                             MethodHandles.insertArguments(multiplyExact, 0, 4L));
 * intHandle.get(segment, 3L); // get int element at offset 3 * 4 = 12
 * }
 *
 * Alternatively, complex var handles can can be obtained
 * from {@linkplain MemoryLayout#varHandle(MemoryLayout.PathElement...) memory layouts}
 * by providing a so called <a href="MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths"><em>layout path</em></a>:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemorySegment segment = ...
 * VarHandle intHandle = ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.arrayElementVarHandle();
 * intHandle.get(segment, 3L); // get int element at offset 3 * 4 = 12
 * }
 *
 * <h2 id="slicing">Slicing memory segments</h2>
 *
 * Memory segments support {@linkplain MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long) slicing}. Slicing a memory segment
 * returns a new memory segment that is backed by the same region of memory as the original. The address of the sliced
 * segment is derived from the address of the original segment, by adding an offset (expressed in bytes). The size of
 * the sliced segment is either derived implicitly (by subtracting the specified offset from the size of the original segment),
 * or provided explicitly. In other words, a sliced segment has <em>stricter</em> spatial bounds than those of the original segment:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * Arena arena = ...
 * MemorySegment segment = arena.allocate(100);
 * MemorySegment slice = segment.asSlice(50, 10);
 * slice.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 20); // Out of bounds!
 * arena.close();
 * slice.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0); // Already closed!
 * }
 * The above code creates a native segment that is 100 bytes long; then, it creates a slice that starts at offset 50
 * of {@code segment}, and is 10 bytes long. That is, the address of the {@code slice} is {@code segment.address() + 50},
 * and its size is 10. As a result, attempting to read an int value at offset 20 of the
 * {@code slice} segment will result in an exception. The {@linkplain SegmentScope temporal bounds} of the original segment
 * is inherited by its slices; that is, when the scope associated with {@code segment} is no longer {@linkplain SegmentScope#isAlive() alive},
 * {@code slice} will also be become inaccessible.
 * <p>
 * A client might obtain a {@link Stream} from a segment, which can then be used to slice the segment (according to a given
 * element layout) and even allow multiple threads to work in parallel on disjoint segment slices
 * (to do this, the segment has to be associated with a scope that allows {@linkplain SegmentScope#isAccessibleBy(Thread) access}
 * from multiple threads). The following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * try (Arena arena = Arena.openShared()) {
 *     SequenceLayout SEQUENCE_LAYOUT = MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(1024, ValueLayout.JAVA_INT);
 *     MemorySegment segment = arena.allocate(SEQUENCE_LAYOUT);
 *     int sum = segment.elements(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT).parallel()
 *                      .mapToInt(s -> s.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0))
 *                      .sum();
 * }
 *}
 *
 * <h2 id="segment-alignment">Alignment</h2>
 *
 * Access operations on a memory segment are constrained not only by the spatial and temporal bounds of the segment,
 * but also by the <em>alignment constraint</em> of the value layout specified to the operation. An access operation can
 * access only those offsets in the segment that denote addresses in physical memory which are <em>aligned</em> according
 * to the layout. An address in physical memory is <em>aligned</em> according to a layout if the address is an integer
 * multiple of the layout's alignment constraint. For example, the address 1000 is aligned according to an 8-byte alignment
 * constraint (because 1000 is an integer multiple of 8), and to a 4-byte alignment constraint, and to a 2-byte alignment
 * constraint; in contrast, the address 1004 is aligned according to a 4-byte alignment constraint, and to a 2-byte alignment
 * constraint, but not to an 8-byte alignment constraint.
 * Access operations are required to respect alignment because it can impact the performance of access operations, and
 * can also determine which access operations are available at a given physical address. For instance,
 * {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.VarHandle#compareAndSet(Object...) atomic access operations} operations using
 * {@link java.lang.invoke.VarHandle} are only permitted at aligned addresses. In addition, alignment
 * applies to an access operation whether the segment being accessed is a native segment or a heap segment.
 * <p>
 * If the segment being accessed is a native segment, then its {@linkplain #address() address} in physical memory can be
 * combined with the offset to obtain the <em>target address</em> in physical memory. The pseudo-function below demonstrates this:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * boolean isAligned(MemorySegment segment, long offset, MemoryLayout layout) {
 *   return ((segment.address() + offset) % layout.byteAlignment()) == 0;
 * }
 * }
 *
 * For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A native segment with address 1000 can be accessed at offsets 0, 8, 16, 24, etc under an 8-byte alignment constraint,
 * because the target addresses (1000, 1008, 1016, 1024) are 8-byte aligned.
 * Access at offsets 1-7 or 9-15 or 17-23 is disallowed because the target addresses would not be 8-byte aligned.</li>
 * <li>A native segment with address 1000 can be accessed at offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, etc under a 4-byte alignment constraint,
 * because the target addresses (1000, 1004, 1008, 1012) are 4-byte aligned.
 * Access at offsets 1-3 or 5-7 or 9-11 is disallowed because the target addresses would not be 4-byte aligned.</li>
 * <li>A native segment with address 1000 can be accessed at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint,
 * because the target addresses (1000, 1002, 1004, 1006) are 2-byte aligned.
 * Access at offsets 1 or 3 or 5 is disallowed because the target addresses would not be 2-byte aligned.</li>
 * <li>A native segment with address 1004 can be accessed at offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, etc under a 4-byte alignment constraint,
 * and at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint.
 * Under an 8-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 4, 12, 20, 28, etc.</li>
 * <li>A native segment with address 1006 can be accessed at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint.
 * Under a 4-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 2, 6, 10, 14, etc.
 * Under an 8-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 2, 10, 18, 26, etc.
 * <li>A native segment with address 1007 can be accessed at offsets 0, 1, 2, 3, etc under a 1-byte alignment constraint.
 * Under a 2-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.
 * Under a 4-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 1, 5, 9, 13, etc.
 * Under an 8-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 1, 9, 17, 25, etc.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The alignment constraint used to access a segment is typically dictated by the shape of the data structure stored
 * in the segment. For example, if the programmer wishes to store a sequence of 8-byte values in a native segment, then
 * the segment should be allocated by specifying a 8-byte alignment constraint, either via {@link #allocateNative(long, long, SegmentScope)}
 * or {@link #allocateNative(MemoryLayout, SegmentScope)}. These factories ensure that the off-heap region of memory backing
 * the returned segment has a starting address that is 8-byte aligned. Subsequently, the programmer can access the
 * segment at the offsets of interest -- 0, 8, 16, 24, etc -- in the knowledge that every such access is aligned.
 * <p>
 * If the segment being accessed is a heap segment, then determining whether access is aligned is more complex.
 * The address of the segment in physical memory is not known, and is not even fixed (it may change when the segment
 * is relocated during garbage collection). This means that the address cannot be combined with the specified offset to
 * determine a target address in physical memory. Since the alignment constraint <em>always</em> refers to alignment of
 * addresses in physical memory, it is not possible in principle to determine if any offset in a heap segment is aligned.
 * For example, suppose the programmer chooses a 8-byte alignment constraint and tries
 * to access offset 16 in a heap segment. If the heap segment's address 0 corresponds to physical address 1000,
 * then the target address (1016) would be aligned, but if address 0 corresponds to physical address 1004,
 * then the target address (1020) would not be aligned. It is undesirable to allow access to target addresses that are
 * aligned according to the programmer's chosen alignment constraint, but might not be predictably aligned in physical memory
 * (e.g. because of platform considerations and/or garbage collection behavior).
 * <p>
 * In practice, the Java runtime lays out arrays in memory so that each n-byte element occurs at an n-byte
 * aligned physical address. The runtime preserves this invariant even if the array is relocated during garbage
 * collection. Access operations rely on this invariant to determine if the specified offset in a heap segment refers
 * to an aligned address in physical memory. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The starting physical address of a {@code long[]} array will be 8-byte aligned (e.g. 1000), so that successive long elements
 * occur at 8-byte aligned addresses (e.g., 1000, 1008, 1016, 1024, etc.) A heap segment backed by a {@code long[]} array
 * can be accessed at offsets 0, 8, 16, 24, etc under an 8-byte alignment constraint. In addition, the segment can be
 * accessed at offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, etc under a 4-byte alignment constraint, because the target addresses
 * (1000, 1004, 1008, 1012) are 4-byte aligned. And, the segment can be accessed at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a
 * 2-byte alignment constraint, because the target addresses (e.g. 1000, 1002, 1004, 1006) are 2-byte aligned.</li>
 * <li>The starting physical address of a {@code short[]} array will be 2-byte aligned (e.g. 1006) so that successive
 * short elements occur at 2-byte aligned addresses (e.g. 1006, 1008, 1010, 1012, etc). A heap segment backed by a
 * {@code short[]} array can be accessed at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint. The segment cannot
 * be accessed at <em>any</em> offset under a 4-byte alignment constraint, because there is no guarantee that the target
 * address would be 4-byte aligned, e.g., offset 0 would correspond to physical address 1006 while offset 1 would correspond
 * to physical address 1007. Similarly, the segment cannot be accessed at any offset under an 8-byte alignment constraint,
 * because because there is no guarantee that the target address would be 8-byte aligned, e.g., offset 2 would correspond
 * to physical address 1008 but offset 4 would correspond to physical address 1010.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In other words, heap segments feature a <em>maximum</em> alignment which is derived from the size of the elements of
 * the Java array backing the segment, as shown in the following table:
 *
 * <blockquote><table class="plain">
 * <caption style="display:none">Maximum alignment of heap segments</caption>
 * <thead>
 * <tr>
 *     <th scope="col">Array type (of backing region)</th>
 *     <th scope="col">Maximum supported alignment (in bytes)</th>

 * </tbody>
 * </table></blockquote>
 *
 * Heap segments can only be accessed using a layout whose alignment is smaller or equal to the
 * maximum alignment associated with the heap segment. Attempting to access a heap segment using a layout
 * whose alignment is greater than the maximum alignment associated with the heap segment will fail,
 * as demonstrated in the following example:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemorySegment byteSegment = MemorySegment.ofArray(new byte[10]);
 * byteSegment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0); // fails: layout alignment is 4, segment max alignment is 1
 * }
 *
 * In such circumstances, clients have two options. They can use a heap segment backed by a different array
 * type (e.g. {@code long[]}), capable of supporting greater maximum alignment:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemorySegment longSegment = MemorySegment.ofArray(new long[10]);
 * longSegment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0); // ok: layout alignment is 4, segment max alignment is 8
 * }
 *
 * Alternatively, they can invoke the access operation with an <em>unaligned layout</em>.
 * All unaligned layout constants (e.g. {@link ValueLayout#JAVA_INT_UNALIGNED}) have their alignment constraint set to 1:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemorySegment byteSegment = MemorySegment.ofArray(new byte[10]);
 * byteSegment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT_UNALIGNED, 0); // ok: layout alignment is 1, segment max alignment is 1
 * }
 *
 * <h2 id="wrapping-addresses">Zero-length memory segments</h2>
 *
 * When interacting with <a href="package-summary.html#ffa">foreign functions</a>, it is common for those functions
 * to allocate a region of memory and return a pointer to that region. Modeling the region of memory with a memory segment
 * is challenging because the Java runtime has no insight into the size of the region. Only the address of the start of
 * the region, stored in the pointer, is available. For example, a C function with return type {@code char*} might return
 * a pointer to a region containing a single {@code char} value, or to a region containing an array of {@code char} values,
 * where the size of the array might be provided in a separate parameter. The size of the array is not readily apparent
 * to the code calling the foreign function and hoping to use its result.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Linker} represents a pointer returned from a foreign function with a <em>zero-length memory segment</em>.
 * The address of the segment is the address stored in the pointer. The size of the segment is zero. Similarly, when a
 * client reads an <em>address</em> from a memory segment, a zero-length memory segment is returned.
 * <p>
 * Since a zero-length segment features trivial spatial bounds, any attempt to access these segments will fail with
 * {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException}. This is a crucial safety feature: as these segments are associated with a region
 * of memory whose size is not known, any access operations involving these segments cannot be validated.
 * In effect, a zero-length memory segment <em>wraps</em> an address, and it cannot be used without explicit intent.
 * <p>
 * Zero-length memory segments obtained when interacting with foreign functions are associated with the
 * {@link SegmentScope#global() global scope}. This is because the Java runtime, in addition to having no insight
 * into the size of the region of memory backing a pointer returned from a foreign function, also has no insight
 * into the lifetime intended for said region of memory by the foreign function that allocated it. The global scope
 * ensures that the obtained segment can be passed, opaquely, to other pointer-accepting foreign functions.
 * <p>
 * To access native zero-length memory segments, clients have two options, both of which are <em>unsafe</em>. Clients
 * can {@linkplain java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment#ofAddress(long, long, SegmentScope) obtain}
 * a <em>new</em> native segment, with new spatial and temporal bounds, as follows:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * SegmentScope scope = ... // obtains a scope
 * MemorySegment foreign = someSegment.get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, 0); // wrap address into segment (size = 0)
 * MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.ofAddress(foreign.address(), 4, scope); // create new segment (size = 4)
 * int x = segment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0); //ok
 *}
 *
 * Alternatively, clients can obtain an {@linkplain java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.OfAddress#asUnbounded() unbounded}
 * address value layout. When an access operation, or a function descriptor that is passed to a downcall method handle,
 * uses an unbounded address value layouts, the runtime will wrap any corresponding raw addresses with native segments
 * with <em>maximal</em> size (i.e. {@linkplain java.lang.Long#MAX_VALUE}). As such, these segments can be accessed directly, as follows:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * MemorySegment foreign = someSegment.get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS.asUnbounded(), 0); // wrap address into segment (size = Long.MAX_VALUE)
 * int x = foreign.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0); //ok
 *}
 *
 * Both {@link #ofAddress(long, long, SegmentScope)} and {@link ValueLayout.OfAddress#asUnbounded()} are
 * <a href="package-summary.html#restricted"><em>restricted</em></a> methods, and should be used with caution:
 * for instance, sizing a segment incorrectly could result in a VM crash when attempting to access the memory segment.
 * <p>
 * Which approach is taken largely depends on the information that a client has available when obtaining a memory segment
 * wrapping a native pointer. For instance, if such pointer points to a C struct, the client might prefer to resize the
 * segment unsafely, to match the size of the struct (so that out-of-bounds access will be detected by the API).
 * In other instances, however, there will be no, or little information as to what spatial and/or temporal bounds should
 * be associated with a given native pointer. In these cases using an unbounded address layout might be preferable.
