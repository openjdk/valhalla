/**
 * A linker provides access to foreign functions from Java code, and access to Java code from foreign functions.
 * <p>
 * Foreign functions typically reside in libraries that can be loaded on-demand. Each library conforms to
 * a specific ABI (Application Binary Interface). An ABI is a set of calling conventions and data types associated with
 * the compiler, OS, and processor where the library was built. For example, a C compiler on Linux/x64 usually
 * builds libraries that conform to the SystemV ABI.
 * <p>
 * A linker has detailed knowledge of the calling conventions and data types used by a specific ABI.
 * For any library which conforms to that ABI, the linker can mediate between Java code running
 * in the JVM and foreign functions in the library. In particular:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A linker allows Java code to link against foreign functions, via
 * {@linkplain #downcallHandle(MemorySegment, FunctionDescriptor, Option...) downcall method handles}; and</li>
 * <li>A linker allows foreign functions to call Java method handles,
 * via the generation of {@linkplain #upcallStub(MethodHandle, FunctionDescriptor, SegmentScope) upcall stubs}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In addition, a linker provides a way to look up foreign functions in libraries that conform to the ABI. Each linker
 * chooses a set of libraries that are commonly used on the OS and processor combination associated with the ABI.
 * For example, a linker for Linux/x64 might choose two libraries: {@code libc} and {@code libm}. The functions in these
 * libraries are exposed via a {@linkplain #defaultLookup() symbol lookup}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #nativeLinker()} method provides a linker for the ABI associated with the OS and processor where the Java runtime
 * is currently executing. This linker also provides access, via its {@linkplain #defaultLookup() default lookup},
 * to the native libraries loaded with the Java runtime.
 *
 * <h2 id="downcall-method-handles">Downcall method handles</h2>
 *
 * {@linkplain #downcallHandle(FunctionDescriptor, Option...) Linking a foreign function} is a process which requires a function descriptor,
 * a set of memory layouts which, together, specify the signature of the foreign function to be linked, and returns,
 * when complete, a downcall method handle, that is, a method handle that can be used to invoke the target foreign function.
 * <p>
 * The Java {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodType method type} associated with the returned method handle is
 * {@linkplain FunctionDescriptor#toMethodType() derived} from the argument and return layouts in the function descriptor.
 * The downcall method handle type, might then be decorated by additional leading parameters, in the given order if both are present:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the downcall method handle is created {@linkplain #downcallHandle(FunctionDescriptor, Option...) without specifying a target address},
 * the downcall method handle type features a leading parameter of type {@link MemorySegment}, from which the
 * address of the target foreign function can be derived.</li>
 * <li>If the function descriptor's return layout is a group layout, the resulting downcall method handle accepts
 * an additional leading parameter of type {@link SegmentAllocator}, which is used by the linker runtime to allocate the
 * memory region associated with the struct returned by the downcall method handle.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2 id="upcall-stubs">Upcall stubs</h2>
 *
 * {@linkplain #upcallStub(MethodHandle, FunctionDescriptor, SegmentScope) Creating an upcall stub} requires a method
 * handle and a function descriptor; in this case, the set of memory layouts in the function descriptor
 * specify the signature of the function pointer associated with the upcall stub.
 * <p>
 * The type of the provided method handle's type has to match the method type associated with the upcall stub,
 * which is {@linkplain FunctionDescriptor#toMethodType() derived} from the provided function descriptor.
 * <p>
 * Upcall stubs are modelled by instances of type {@link MemorySegment}; upcall stubs can be passed by reference to other
 * downcall method handles and, they are released via their associated {@linkplain SegmentScope scope}.
 *
 * <h2 id="safety">Safety considerations</h2>
 *
 * Creating a downcall method handle is intrinsically unsafe. A symbol in a foreign library does not, in general,
 * contain enough signature information (e.g. arity and types of foreign function parameters). As a consequence,
 * the linker runtime cannot validate linkage requests. When a client interacts with a downcall method handle obtained
 * through an invalid linkage request (e.g. by specifying a function descriptor featuring too many argument layouts),
 * the result of such interaction is unspecified and can lead to JVM crashes. On downcall handle invocation,
 * the linker runtime guarantees the following for any argument {@code A} of type {@link MemorySegment} whose corresponding
 * layout is {@link ValueLayout#ADDRESS}:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The scope of {@code A} is {@linkplain SegmentScope#isAlive() alive}. Otherwise, the invocation throws
 *     {@link IllegalStateException};</li>
 *     <li>The invocation occurs in a thread {@code T} such that {@code A.scope().isAccessibleBy(T) == true}.
 *     Otherwise, the invocation throws {@link WrongThreadException}; and</li>
 *     <li>The scope of {@code A} is {@linkplain SegmentScope#whileAlive(Runnable) kept alive} during the invocation.</li>
 *</ul>
 * A downcall method handle created from a function descriptor whose return layout is an
 * {@linkplain ValueLayout.OfAddress address layout} returns a native segment associated with
 * the {@linkplain SegmentScope#global() global scope}. Under normal conditions, the size of the returned segment is {@code 0}.
 * However, if the return layout is an {@linkplain ValueLayout.OfAddress#asUnbounded() unbounded} address layout,
 * then the size of the returned segment is {@code Long.MAX_VALUE}.
 * <p>
 * When creating upcall stubs the linker runtime validates the type of the target method handle against the provided
 * function descriptor and report an error if any mismatch is detected. As for downcalls, JVM crashes might occur,
 * if the foreign code casts the function pointer associated with an upcall stub to a type
 * that is incompatible with the provided function descriptor. Moreover, if the target method
 * handle associated with an upcall stub returns a {@linkplain MemorySegment memory segment}, clients must ensure
 * that this address cannot become invalid after the upcall completes. This can lead to unspecified behavior,
 * and even JVM crashes, since an upcall is typically executed in the context of a downcall method handle invocation.
 * <p>
 * An upcall stub argument whose corresponding layout is an {@linkplain ValueLayout.OfAddress address layout}
 * is a native segment associated with the {@linkplain SegmentScope#global() global scope}.
 * Under normal conditions, the size of this segment argument is {@code 0}. However, if the layout associated with
 * the upcall stub argument is an {@linkplain ValueLayout.OfAddress#asUnbounded() unbounded} address layout,
 * then the size of the segment argument is {@code Long.MAX_VALUE}.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * Implementations of this interface are immutable, thread-safe and <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>.

     *     to the size and alignment constraint of a composite type definition in C (e.g. using {@code struct} or {@code union}); and</li>
     *     <li>Pointer types are modelled by a {@linkplain ValueLayout value layout} instance with carrier {@link MemorySegment}.
     *     Examples of pointer types in C are {@code int**} and {@code int(*)(size_t*, size_t*)};</li>
     * </ul>

     * <p>
     * Variadic functions (e.g. a C function declared with a trailing ellipses {@code ...} at the end of the formal parameter
     * list or with an empty formal parameter list) are not supported directly. However, it is possible to link a

     * the start of the list of variadic arguments, together with a specialized function descriptor describing a
     * given variable arity callsite. Alternatively, where the foreign library allows it, clients might be able to
     * interact with variadic functions by passing a trailing parameter of type {@link VaList} (e.g. as in {@code vsprintf}).
     * <p>
     * This method is <a href="package-summary.html#restricted"><em>restricted</em></a>.
     * Restricted methods are unsafe, and, if used incorrectly, their use might crash
