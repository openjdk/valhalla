/**
 * A <em>symbol lookup</em> retrieves the address of a symbol in one or more libraries.
 * A symbol is a named entity, such as a function or a global variable.
 * <p>
 * A symbol lookup is created with respect to a particular library (or libraries). Subsequently, the {@link SymbolLookup#find(String)}
 * method takes the name of a symbol and returns the address of the symbol in that library.
 * <p>
 * The address of a symbol is modelled as a zero-length {@linkplain MemorySegment memory segment}. The segment can be used in different ways:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>It can be passed to a {@link Linker} to create a downcall method handle, which can then be used to call the foreign function at the segment's address.</li>
 *     <li>It can be passed to an existing {@linkplain Linker#downcallHandle(FunctionDescriptor, Linker.Option...) downcall method handle}, as an argument to the underlying foreign function.</li>
 *     <li>It can be {@linkplain MemorySegment#set(ValueLayout.OfAddress, long, MemorySegment) stored} inside another memory segment.</li>
 *     <li>It can be used to access the region of memory backing a global variable (this might require
 *     {@link MemorySegment#ofAddress(long, long, SegmentScope) resizing} the segment first).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2 id="obtaining">Obtaining a symbol lookup</h2>
 *
 * The factory methods {@link #libraryLookup(String, SegmentScope)} and {@link #libraryLookup(Path, SegmentScope)}
 * create a symbol lookup for a library known to the operating system. The library is specified by either its name or a path.
 * The library is loaded if not already loaded. The symbol lookup, which is known as a <em>library lookup</em>, is associated
 * with a {@linkplain  SegmentScope scope}; when the scope becomes not {@link SegmentScope#isAlive()}, the library is unloaded:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * try (Arena arena = Arena.openConfined()) {
 *     SymbolLookup libGL = SymbolLookup.libraryLookup("libGL.so", arena.scope()); // libGL.so loaded here
 *     MemorySegment glGetString = libGL.find("glGetString").orElseThrow();
 *     ...
 * } //  libGL.so unloaded here
 *}
 * <p>
 * If a library was previously loaded through JNI, i.e., by {@link System#load(String)}
 * or {@link System#loadLibrary(String)}, then the library was also associated with a particular class loader. The factory
 * method {@link #loaderLookup()} creates a symbol lookup for all the libraries associated with the caller's class loader:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * System.loadLibrary("GL"); // libGL.so loaded here
 * ...
 * SymbolLookup libGL = SymbolLookup.loaderLookup();
 * MemorySegment glGetString = libGL.find("glGetString").orElseThrow();
 * }
 *
 * This symbol lookup, which is known as a <em>loader lookup</em>, is dynamic with respect to the libraries associated
 * with the class loader. If other libraries are subsequently loaded through JNI and associated with the class loader,
 * then the loader lookup will expose their symbols automatically.
 * <p>
 * Note that a loader lookup only exposes symbols in libraries that were previously loaded through JNI, i.e.,
 * by {@link System#load(String)} or {@link System#loadLibrary(String)}. A loader lookup does not expose symbols in libraries
 * that were loaded in the course of creating a library lookup:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * libraryLookup("libGL.so", scope).find("glGetString").isPresent(); // true
 * loaderLookup().find("glGetString").isPresent(); // false
 *}
 *
 * Note also that a library lookup for library {@code L} exposes symbols in {@code L} even if {@code L} was previously loaded
 * through JNI (the association with a class loader is immaterial to the library lookup):
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * System.loadLibrary("GL"); // libGL.so loaded here
 * libraryLookup("libGL.so", scope).find("glGetString").isPresent(); // true
 *}
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally, each {@link Linker} provides a symbol lookup for libraries that are commonly used on the OS and processor
 * combination supported by that {@link Linker}. This symbol lookup, which is known as a <em>default lookup</em>,
 * helps clients to quickly find addresses of well-known symbols. For example, a {@link Linker} for Linux/x64 might choose to
 * expose symbols in {@code libc} through the default lookup:
 *
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * Linker nativeLinker = Linker.nativeLinker();
 * SymbolLookup stdlib = nativeLinker.defaultLookup();
 * MemorySegment malloc = stdlib.find("malloc").orElseThrow();
 *}
