/**
 * Helper class to create and manipulate variable argument lists, similar in functionality to a C {@code va_list}.
 * <p>
 * A variable argument list can be created using the {@link #make(Consumer, SegmentScope)} factory, as follows:
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * VaList vaList = VaList.make(builder ->
 *                                    builder.addVarg(C_INT, 42)
 *                                           .addVarg(C_DOUBLE, 3.8d));
 *}
 * Once created, clients can obtain the platform-dependent {@linkplain #segment() memory segment} associated with a variable
 * argument list, which can then be passed to {@linkplain Linker#downcallHandle(FunctionDescriptor, Linker.Option...) downcall method handles}
 * targeting native functions using the C {@code va_list} type.
 * <p>
 * The contents of a foreign memory segment modelling a variable argument list can be accessed by <em>unsafely</em> creating
 * a variable argument list, as follows:
 * {@snippet lang = java:
 * void upcall(int n, MemorySegment vaListSegment) {
 *    try (Arena arena = Arena.openConfined()) {
 *        VaList vaList = VaList.ofAddress(vaListSegment.address(), arena.scope());
 *        VaList copy = vaList.copy();
 *        int i = vaList.nextVarg(C_INT);
 *        double d = vaList.nextVarg(C_DOUBLE);
 *        // and again
 *        int i = copy.nextVarg(C_INT);
 *        double d = copy.nextVarg(C_DOUBLE);
 *     }
 * }
 *}
 * The above method receives a foreign segment modelling a variable argument list; the contents of the segment are accessed by creating
 * a new variable argument list, from the segment address. Note that the variable argument list is first copied into
 * a second list before any element is accessed: this will allow us to iterate through the elements twice. Elements in
 * the variable argument list are accessed using {@link #nextVarg(ValueLayout.OfInt)} and
 * {@link #nextVarg(ValueLayout.OfDouble)}. These methods (as well as other access methods in the {@link VaList} class)
 * take the layout of the element that needs to be accessed and perform all the necessary alignment checks as well
 * as endianness conversions.
 * <p>
 * Per the C specification (see C99 standard 6.5.2.2 Function calls - item 6),
 * arguments to variadic calls are erased by way of 'default argument promotions',
 * which erases integral types by way of integer promotion (see C99 standard 6.3.1.1 - item 2),
 * and which erases all {@code float} arguments to {@code double}.
 * <p>
 * As such, this interface only supports reading {@code int}, {@code double},
 * and any other type that fits into a {@code long}.
 * <h2 id="safety">Safety considerations</h2>
 * Accessing a value through a variable argument list using the wrong memory layout will result in undefined behavior.
 * For instance, if a variable argument list currently points at a C {@code int} value, then accessing it using
 * {@link #nextVarg(ValueLayout.OfLong)} is illegal. Similarly, accessing the variable argument list with
 * {@link #skip(MemoryLayout...)}, and providing a layout other than {@link ValueLayout.OfInt} is illegal.
 * Any such illegal accesses might not be detected by the implementation, and can corrupt the variable argument list,
 * so that the behavior of subsequent accesses is also undefined.
 * <p>
 * It is possible for clients to access elements outside the spatial bounds of a variable argument list.
 * Variable argument list implementations will try to detect out-of-bounds reads on a best-effort basis.
 * <p>
 * Whether this detection succeeds depends on the factory method used to create the variable argument list:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Variable argument lists created <em>safely</em>, using {@link #make(Consumer, SegmentScope)} are capable of detecting out-of-bounds reads;</li>
 *     <li>Variable argument lists created <em>unsafely</em>, using {@link #ofAddress(long, SegmentScope)} are not capable of detecting out-of-bounds reads</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This class is not thread safe, and all accesses should occur within a single thread
 * (regardless of the scope used to obtain the variable arity list).
