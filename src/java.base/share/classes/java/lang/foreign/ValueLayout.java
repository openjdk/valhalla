/**
 * A layout that models values of basic data types. Examples of values modelled by a value layout are
 * <em>integral</em> values (either signed or unsigned), <em>floating-point</em> values and
 * <em>address</em> values.
 * <p>
 * Each value layout has a size, an alignment (in bits),
 * a {@linkplain ByteOrder byte order}, and a <em>carrier</em>, that is, the Java type that should be used when
 * {@linkplain MemorySegment#get(OfInt, long) accessing} a region of memory using the value layout.
 * <p>
 * This class defines useful value layout constants for Java primitive types and addresses.
 * The layout constants in this class make implicit alignment and byte-ordering assumption: all layout
 * constants in this class are byte-aligned, and their byte order is set to the {@linkplain ByteOrder#nativeOrder() platform default},
 * thus making it easy to work with other APIs, such as arrays and {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer}.
 *
 * @implSpec implementing classes and subclasses are immutable, thread-safe and <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>.

     * As a result, if {@code shape.length == 0}, the array layout will feature only one dimension.
     * <p>
     * The resulting var handle will feature {@code sizes.length + 1} coordinates of type {@code long}, which are

     *
     * The resulting var handle {@code arrayHandle} will feature 3 coordinates of type {@code long}; each coordinate
     * is interpreted as an index into the corresponding sequence layout. If we refer to the var handle coordinates, from left
     * to right, as {@code x}, {@code y} and {@code z} respectively, the final offset accessed by the var handle can be
     * computed with the following formula:
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>{@code
     * offset = (10 * 20 * 4 * x) + (20 * 4 * y) + (4 * z)
     * }</pre></blockquote>
     *
     * Additionally, the values of {@code x}, {@code y} and {@code z} are constrained as follows:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>{@code 0 <= x < arrayLayout.elementCount() }</li>
     *     <li>{@code 0 <= y < 10 }</li>
     *     <li>{@code 0 <= z < 20 }</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Consider the following access expressions:
     * {@snippet lang=java :
     * int value1 = arrayHandle.get(10, 2, 4); // ok, accessed offset = 8176
     * int value2 = arrayHandle.get(0, 0, 30); // out of bounds value for z
     * }
     * In the first case, access is well-formed, as the values for {@code x}, {@code y} and {@code z} conform to
     * the bounds specified above. In the second case, access fails with {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException},
     * as the value for {@code z} is outside its specified bounds.
