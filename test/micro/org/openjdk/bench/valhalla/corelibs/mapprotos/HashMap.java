/**
 * HashMap using hashing and "open addressing".
 * Hash entries are inline class instances.
 * As described in <em>Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press)</em>,
 * Section 11 Hash tables and Section 11.4 Open addressing.
 *
 * Open addressing is used to locate other entries for keys with the same hash.
 * If multiple keys have the same hashcode, a rehashing mechanism
 * is used to place the 2nd and subsequent
 * key/value pairs at a non-optimal index in the table. Therefore,
 * finding the entry for a desired key must rehash and examine subsequent
 * entries until the value is value or it encounters an empty entry.
 * When an entry is removed, the entry is marked as deleted, (not empty)
 * to allow the search algorithm to keep looking; otherwise it would terminate
 * the scan on the deleted entry, when it might be the case for some (other) key
 * would have that same entry as part of its chain of possible locations for its hash.
 * The default load factor (.75) should be re-evaluated in light of the open addressing
 * computations.  A higher number would reduce unused (wasted) space at the cost of
 * increased search times, a lower number would increase unused (wasted) space but
 * improve search times (assuming even hashcode distributions).
 * Badly distributed hash values will result in incremental table growth and
 * linear search performance.
 * <p>
 * During insertion the Robin Hood hash algorithm does a small optimization
 * to reduce worst case rehash lengths.
 * Removal of entries, does a compaction of the following entries to fill
 * in free entries and reduce entry rehashling lengths based on
 * "On Deletions in Open Addressing Hashing", by Rosa M. Jimenez and Conrado Martinz.
 *
 * <p>
 * The only allocation that occurs during put operations is for the resizing of the entry table.
 *
 * <P>
 * Hash table based implementation of the {@code Map} interface.  This
 * implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 * {@code null} values and the {@code null} key.  (The {@code HashMap}
 * class is roughly equivalent to {@code Hashtable}, except that it is
 * unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
 * the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order
 * will remain constant over time.
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic
 * operations ({@code get} and {@code put}), assuming the hash function
 * disperses the elements properly among the buckets.  Iteration over
 * collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the
 * {@code HashMap} instance (the number of buckets) plus its size (the number
 * of key-value mappings).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
 * capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is
 * important.
 *
 * <p>An instance of {@code HashMap} has two parameters that affect its
 * performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
 * <i>capacity</i> is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial
 * capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.  The
 * <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to
 * get before its capacity is automatically increased.  When the number of
 * entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the
 * current capacity, the hash table is <i>rehashed</i> (that is, internal data
 * structures are rebuilt) so that the hash table has approximately twice the
 * number of buckets.
 *
 * <p>As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good
 * tradeoff between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the
 * space overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of
 * the operations of the {@code HashMap} class, including
 * {@code get} and {@code put}).  The expected number of entries in
 * the map and its load factor should be taken into account when
 * setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the number of
 * rehash operations.  If the initial capacity is greater than the
 * maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash
 * operations will ever occur.
 *
 * <p>If many mappings are to be stored in a {@code HashMap}
 * instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow
 * the mappings to be stored more efficiently than letting it perform
 * automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.  Note that using
 * many keys with the same {@code hashCode()} is a sure way to slow
 * down performance of any hash table.
 * TBD: To ameliorate impact, when keys
 * are {@link Comparable}, this class may use comparison order among
 * keys to help break ties.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of
 * the threads modifies the map structurally, it <i>must</i> be
 * synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 * that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
 * associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
 * structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
 *   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods"
 * are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
 * the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * {@code remove} method, the iterator will throw a
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
