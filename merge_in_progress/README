# This README notes unresolved merge conflicts that were committed so that
# others may help resolve them. Please remove entries from the list that you
# have resolved.
#
# In the sub-directory "original_conflicts" you will find the original merge
# conflict source. In case you wish to check for a badly resolved conflict.
#
# This entire "merge_in_progress" directory can be removed once all conflicts
# are both merged and tested to a satisfactory level.
